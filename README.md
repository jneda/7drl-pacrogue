# PacRogue - 7DRL 2020

Play it at [jneda.github.io/7drl-pacrogue/](https://jneda.github.io/7drl-pacrogue/).
Collect the blue dots without getting caught by the spooky ghosts. 
Use arrow keys to move around.

Inspired by [the Pac-Man Dossier](https://pacman.holenet.info/).

Made with bad practices, too little knowledge of data structures, brute force, JavaScript, and [rot.js](https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/)
